# CRITICAL WORKFLOW

It is **EXTREMELY IMPORTANT** that all AI agents follow this workflow step by step, organizing task receipt, analysis, global planning, agent assignment, detailed per-task plans, and git version control.

## Steps

### 1. Task Origin

- **Chat**: If a task is shared in chat (unless user indicates a TODO file), create new TODO file in `.agent/todos/<YYYYMMDD>/<YYYYMMDD>-todo-<number>.md` with the request.
- **TODO File**: Primary source is `.agent/todos` directory; process files in chronological/numerical order; skip files with `-DONE` suffix.
- **TODO File Format**:
  - **Line Items**: Each line is a task.
  - **Section Items** — apply the first matching pattern:
    - **Pattern C** (`# Title` → `## Tasks` → `### Heading`): each `###` inside a `## Tasks` section is one task.
    - **Pattern B** (`# Title` → `## Heading`): each `##` section is one task.
    - **Pattern A** (multiple `# Heading`): each `#` section is one task.
    - Sub-items under a task heading belong to that task and do **not** spawn new tasks.
    - If no pattern matches, ask the user for clarification.
  - **Other Formats**: Ask user for clarification.
- **Plan Agent**:
  1. Receives requests, creates/reads TODO file.
  2. Generates a global plan file for steps 2–6 where **each TODO task gets its own 4.1–4.6 cycle** (never group multiple items into one Task).
  3. Do NOT call `plan_exit`. Instead, present the global plan to the user using the `question` tool (include "Approve this and all 4.1 Future Plans" option); or auto-approve if request or TODO file includes "Don't request me to approve plans".
  4. After approval, delegates steps to sub-agents via `task` tool, including relevant context (TODO path, task description, plan path, constraints) in each prompt.
- **Ask Agent**: Handles user communication; called by Plan Agent via `task` tool.

### 2. Git Feature Branch Setup

Plan Agent assigns implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`). `main` is master branch.

- Run `git status`: Commit unstaged files with meaningful message. **Before committing, follow [Gitignore Compliance Rule](../.kilo/rules/gitignore-compliance.md).**
- Switch to `main`:
  - If there already, proceed.
  - Else, ask user to merge current branch:
    - Yes: Checkout `main`, merge; if conflicts, ask user to resolve; if success, remove merged branch.
    - No: Checkout `main`.
- Create new branch:
  - Features: `feat/<descriptive-name>` (default)
  - Fixes: `fix/<descriptive-name>`
  - All work in created branch; merge to `main` at end of *Critical Workflow*.
- Switch to new branch.

### 3. Version Update

Plan Agent assigns implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`).

- If version exists (e.g., `package.json`), increment per semver (patch for fixes, minor for features, major for breaking); commit as 'chore: bump version to x.y.z'.

### 4. Task Execution

#### 4.0 Overall Process Management

- **CRITICAL**: Each step (4.1–4.6) MUST be a separate `task` tool invocation. Do NOT assign the entire global plan or all 4.x steps for a task to a single sub-agent.
- **Compliance Self-Check**: Before any 4.x sub-step, verify you are the Plan Agent orchestrating via `task` tool, the sub-step uses the correct `subagent_type`, and the task maps 1:1 to a single TODO item. If not, stop and re-read this workflow.
- Process TODO tasks in file order. Before a new task, commit pending changes.
- On failures: pause and invoke Ask Agent for user intervention.
- **Context Passing**: when delegating via `task` tool, include relevant context (TODO path, task description, plan path, constraints, etc) in the prompt. Sub-agents read project context files independently.

#### Sub-Task Prompt Requirements

Every `task` tool invocation from the Plan Agent MUST include this preamble before task-specific instructions:

```text
SUB-AGENT TASK — SINGLE DISCRETE STEP
- You are executing exactly ONE step of a larger Critical Workflow plan.
- Do ONLY what is described below. Do NOT execute subsequent steps.
- Do NOT read or expand scope to the global plan for other tasks.
- Prefer mcp tools, like vscode-mcp-server_* and Bifrost_*. Tools over bash for code operations. Reserve bash for git/npm/builds/tests.
- The subagent_type parameter MUST match the type specified in the workflow step description for this step.
- Signal completion with a clear summary: what was done, what was NOT done.
- If anything is ambiguous or outside your assigned scope, return question to caller. Do NOT make assumptions.
```

#### 4.1. Analysis and Planning

Assign to architect sub-agent (`subagent_type: "architect"`).

- Identify task ambiguities; analyze project status; research required techs, frameworks, libs, dependencies, and/or APIs.
- Generate implementation plan:
  1. Think high-level approach to implement 1 TODO task, including steps for: git handling, code writing, console cmds (if required), test build (if exists), code review, unit test (if testing suite exists), docs updates.
  2. Use approach to define extensive implementation plan with tiny, detailed steps; include clear file names/paths, structure, code snippets, terminal cmd details, etc.
  3. [CRITICAL] Save to `.kilo/plans/<YYYYMMDD>-<plan-name>.md`.
  4. Compare to original task; redo if incorrect.
- Returns plan so **Plan Agent presents it to user for approval**.
  - Do NOT call `plan_exit`. Instead, use the `question` tool.
  - Auto-approve if request or TODO file includes "Don't request me to approve plans".
  - If feedback/rejection: re-do and re-present.
  - If approved, proceed.

#### 4.2. Implementation

Assign to implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`).

- Follow detailed steps from the implementation plan; check plan between steps.
- IMPORTANT: commit w/meaningful messages. **Before committing, follow [Gitignore Compliance Rule](../.kilo/rules/gitignore-compliance.md).**

#### 4.3. Code Review

Assign to code-reviewer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`).

- Review for errors/deviations from the implementation plan.
- Generate a fix plan; [CRITICAL] save in `.kilo/plans/<YYYYMMDD>-<plan-name>.md`.
- Plan Agent assigns fix plan to implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`) in a new sub-task.
- Max 3 review cycles; escalate to user.

#### 4.4. Documentation

Assign to docs-specialist sub-agent (`subagent_type: "docs-specialist"`).

- Add code comments where needed.
- Update/create project documentation (e.g., README, `/docs`).

#### 4.5. Verification

Assign to implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`).

- Check implementation plan adherence; commit unstaged files. **Before committing, follow [Gitignore Compliance Rule](../.kilo/rules/gitignore-compliance.md).**

#### 4.6. Task Completion

Assign to implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`).

- Add `[DONE]` to task in TODO file:
  - Line Item: append to line.
  - Section Item: append to section title.
  - Other: ask user if unclear.
- Preserve the file original content, just add the `[DONE]` mark, and mark as done any task's sub-items (like `[]` to `[x]`).
- Commit changes with meaningful message; **before committing, follow [Gitignore Compliance Rule](../.kilo/rules/gitignore-compliance.md).**
- Process each task individually; mark as done immediately after completion.

### 5. TODO File Completion

Plan Agent assigns implementer sub-agent (`subagent_type: "implementer"`).

- When all tasks marked as done (see step 4.6), rename TODO file with `-DONE` suffix (e.g., `<YYYYMMDD>-todo-<number>-DONE.md`). **Don't delete the file or change its content.**
- Ensure all files are committed in feature branch.
- Merge feature branch:
  1. Switch to `main` branch.
  2. Merge feature branch:
  - On success: delete feature branch (verify success first).
  - On failure: notify user.
- If `origin` remote is set, push `main` to `origin` ONLY. **Do NOT push to other remotes** (e.g., `base-project`, `upstream`, `template`) unless explicitly instructed. Notify user if push to `origin` fails.

### 6. Continuation

- Check for remaining TODO files.
- If any: propose user to proceed in new chat with

```text
full read @AGENTS.md & follow /critical-workflow
do @/.agent/todos/<file-path>
```

- If none: work finished.

## Example (MUST READ)

### TODO File Example (Line Items format)

```markdown
- Task 1
- Task 2
- Task 3
- Task 4
```

### Global Plan Example

Each entry is a separate `task` tool invocation with the appropriate `subagent_type`:

```markdown
- Step 2: Git Feature Branch Setup => implementer
- Step 3: Version Update => implementer
- Task 1: 4.1 Analysis & Planning => architect
- Task 1: 4.2 Implementation => implementer
- Task 1: 4.3 Code Review => code-reviewer; 4.3-fix => implementer
- Task 1: 4.4 Documentation => docs-specialist
- Task 1: 4.5 Verification => implementer
- Task 1: 4.6 Task Completion => implementer
- (repeat 4.1–4.6 for each remaining task)
- Step 5: TODO File Completion => implementer
```

## Error Handling

- On errors: log details, commit safe changes if possible, notify user, and pause.
- If endless loops or repeated failures occur, escalate to user immediately.
- If a sub-step (4.1–4.6) fails verification (e.g., no completion signal or non-compliance), Plan Agent reassigns the sub-task or escalates to user.
