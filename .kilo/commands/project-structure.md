# Project Structure Maintenance Workflow

## Overview

This workflow manages the creation, updates, and reorganization of the `.agent/project-structure.md` file, which outlines the folder structure inside the `src` directory. The file contains one line per folder path followed by a minimal comment understandable for AI agents.

## Creation Workflow

When the `.agent/project-structure.md` file does not exist:

1. Use `task` tool to assign to Plan sub-agent
2. Plan sub-agent analyzes the project requirements and generates a base folder structure for the `src` directory
3. Plan sub-agent presents the proposed structure to the user for confirmation
4. Upon user confirmation, use `task` tool to assign to Code sub-agent
5. Code sub-agent creates the `.agent/project-structure.md` file with the approved structure

## Update Workflow

When folders are added, removed, or renamed in the `src` directory:

1. Automatically update the `.agent/project-structure.md` file to reflect the current structure
2. Each line contains the folder path relative to `src` followed by a brief AI-agent-understandable comment

## Reorganization Workflow

When the project structure needs reorganization:

1. Use `task` tool to assign to Plan sub-agent
2. Plan sub-agent reviews the current structure in `.agent/project-structure.md` and project context
3. Plan sub-agent proposes a new structure based on current needs
4. Plan sub-agent presents the proposed reorganization to the user for confirmation
5. Upon user confirmation, use `task` tool to assign to Code sub-agent
6. Code sub-agent updates the `.agent/project-structure.md` file with the new structure
7. Code sub-agent may also move existing files/folders to match the new structure if requested

## File Format

- One folder path per line
- Format: `folder/path/ - brief comment for AI agent`
- Comments should be minimal and focused on the folder's purpose from an AI agent's perspective
- Only folders inside `src` are documented (not files)

## Enforcement

- All AI agents must review `.agent/project-structure.md` before creating new files or folders
- This ensures proper placement within the established structure
